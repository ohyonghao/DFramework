Rewriting some STL libraries for school

At Portland State University they require us to write C++ with two hands tied behind our backs, not using the STL at all.
With permission from the teacher I implemented my own Strings class and Node containers.

## Strings
Due to restrictions for the course we had to use cstrings for everything. This implements a string class with an interface
similar to the std::string class with cstrings being used as the internal container.

## Lists
Implemented a linear linked list to satisfy course requirements but using templates to make it a generic container.

## Nodes
Used for linear linked list internal contoiner, also writen with templates as a generic holder.
